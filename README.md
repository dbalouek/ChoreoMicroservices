# ChoreoMicroservices

## How does it work
The three microservices are all different cloud functions in firebase.

An API is exposed to be able to send a zipcode through a url header. This zipcode is stored in firestore's noSQL database.
`curl https://us-central1-weather-microservice-d9385.cloudfunctions.net/addZip?text={ZIP_CODE}`

Another cloud function triggers once this data written which makes a request to the OpenWeather API and retrieves weather data. The temperature along with the name of the city is stored in firestore.

The third and final cloud function triggers when the weather data is written. This function uses the data and sends a tweet out using the npm package [Twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit). The tweets can be found at [@LunchboxScience](https://twitter.com/LunchboxScience)

There is another cloud function which does nothing but log into the console. This function exists for a cron job to ping every 10 minutes to keep the functions warm and prevent slow responses.

To prevent spam and overloads, the service only fulfills requests every 5 minutes for each zip code. The Twitter API also has a limit of 2400 tweets per day with hourly caps. Once a cap is reached, the system will update its database but will not tweet weather.
